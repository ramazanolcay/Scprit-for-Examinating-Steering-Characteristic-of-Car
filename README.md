# Scprit-for-Examinating-Steering-Characteristic-of-Car
All explanations about what the values are available in the comments section of the code.
Lots of value have been assumed because I didn't find a correct value. Also, assumed values are logical for examinated car (Peugeout 2008).

Firt situation makes the car understeer. It is safe but it has difficulty cornering.
Second situation's characteristic is understeer but it shows understeering in high velocities due to first one.
Third stuation makes the car oversteer and it is not wanted behaviour. It's critical speed is not high enough.
